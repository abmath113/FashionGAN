# FashionGAN: Generating Fashion Images using GANs

FashionGAN is a project aimed at generating fashion images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implemented in TensorFlow. This model is trained on the FashionMNIST dataset to create realistic and diverse fashion item images.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown remarkable success in generating synthetic data that closely resembles real data distributions. This project leverages GAN architecture to generate 28x28 fashion images. The FashionMNIST dataset, consisting of grayscale images of various fashion items, serves as the training corpus.
